# Rom-Downloader

Right now the only supported site is vimm which only allows 1 download at a time, but in the future i'll add others and have it do concurrent downloads from other sites.

Also, right now it only downloads everything.  In the future i'll add either system or rom name level downloads. So instead of everything, say just nes or just Pokemon Fire Red, ect.

I'd like to extend this to more than just roms or at least use this for information on how to download things for movies or other things
